# My Enhancement

This is the title of your proposal. Keep it short, simple, and descriptive. A good
title can help communicate what the proposal is and should be considered as part of
any review.

## Summary

The `Summary` section is incredibly important for producing high quality
user-focused documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

## Motivation

This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this proposal. Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.

### Goals

List the specific goals of the proposal. How will we know that this has succeeded?

### Non-Goals

What is out of scope for this proposal? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.

## Proposal

This is where we get down to the specifics of what the enhancement actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real nitty-gritty.

### User Stories

Detail the things that people will be able to do if this is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats [Optional]

What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.

### Risks and Mitigations

What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the ecosystem.

## Design Details

This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.

### Test Plan

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e tests, in addition to unit tests?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

### Version Skew Strategy

How will the component handle version skew with other components?
What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

## Implementation History

Major milestones in the life cycle of a proposal should be tracked in `Implementation
History`.

## Drawbacks

Why should this enhancement __not__ be implemented?

## Alternatives

What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.

## Infrastructure Needed [optional]

Use this section if you need things from the project. Examples include a new repo requested, and/or testing infrastructure.

Listing these here allows the community to get the process for these resources
started right away.
